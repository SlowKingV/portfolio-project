# Portfolio: Setup and mobile version skeleton

> First part of a web portfolio project. We are required to set up a new repository and prepare it for development using best practices (e.g. linters) and build the first 2 sections of the mobile website using the template we chose.


## Built With

- HTML, CSS
- (Used Lighthouse, Webhint, and Stylelint as linters)

### Run tests
If you wish to check the linters on your own, you are going to have to install any you need (or all) of the follow:
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
- [Webhint](https://webhint.io/)
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
